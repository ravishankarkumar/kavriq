LLMs are becoming difficult to avoid. Even if you do not open ChatGPT yourself, you may still interact with language models through search, customer support, writing tools, developer tools, or automated systems inside products you already use.

In short, many of us already use AI directly or indirectly. That makes it worth understanding, at least at a high level, what happens when we send a prompt.

It can feel as if you are talking to a person. You type a question into ChatGPT, or any similar LLM-based product, press **Send**, and a few moments later a response begins appearing on the screen. Many chat interfaces stream the answer gradually, which makes the reply feel conversational rather than mechanical.

But the mechanism underneath is not human conversation. It is a repeated process of turning text into tokens, processing those tokens as numbers, and generating the response one token at a time.

>Before we proceed further, I would liek to tell you that all the concepts that we learn in districbuted systems and regular softwate engineering are stiln valid. But our focus here will be on AI and Mathematics side. As there must be thousands of books and other brilliant resources to cover those aspects. I wil focis on AI.

Your prompt is first broken into small pieces called **tokens**. For example, the sentence:

```text
Tokenization is cool!
```

might be split into something like:

```text
["Token", "ization", " is", " cool", "!"]
```

The exact split depends on the tokenizer, but the basic idea is simple: the model does not process your sentence as one whole object. It works with smaller text units.

After tokenization, each token is converted into numbers. In mathematics and machine learning, a list of numbers that represents something is often called a **vector**. For this explainer, you can think of a vector as an array of numbers.

How tokens become useful vectors is a beautiful subject on its own, but we do not need to go that deep here.

Once the model has these vectors, it processes them together with the available context. The result is a probability distribution over possible next tokens. One token is selected, added to the growing response, and the process repeats.

Those generated tokens become the answer. At a high level, the journey looks like this:

```text
Prompt
→ Tokens
→ Numerical representations
→ Contextual processing
→ Probabilities for the next token
→ Token selection
→ Repeat
→ Readable response
```

Tokens are generated iteratively. That is why many LLM chatbots stream replies gradually, making the answer feel as if it is being written in real time.

Now, let us look at the journey step by step.

## 1. You send a prompt

Suppose you write:

> Why is the sky blue?

After you press **Send**, the text is sent to the systems running ChatGPT.

It gets interesting right away. Your latest prompt is usually not the only thing the system sends to the model. The input may also include instructions that guide the model's behavior, relevant parts of the previous conversation, and results from tools if a feature such as web search was involved.

In other words, the input often contains more than the text you just typed. For now, it is enough to know that the model usually receives a packaged input, not only your latest sentence.

Effectively, the input can be thought of as something like this:

```text
Instructions
+ Relevant conversation
+ Your latest prompt
+ Any applicable tool results
```

The exact composition varies by product, model, settings, and task. For a simple explanation, we will focus on the text of the prompt itself.

### A simple note on tools

A tool is a capability outside the language model that the product can use when text generation alone is not enough.

For example, a system might use:

- web search to look up recent information;
- a calculator to compute an exact result;
- a code runner to execute a small program;
- a file reader to inspect an uploaded document.

The model itself does not become the search engine, calculator, or file reader. Instead, the surrounding product may call one of these tools, collect the result, and add that result back into the context the model can use.

## 2. The prompt is divided into tokens

Language models do not process a sentence as one indivisible object. Before the model can work with it, the text is divided into units called **tokens**.

A token can be:

- a complete word;
- part of a word;
- punctuation;
- a number;
- or sometimes a combination involving spaces and characters.

Our example might be represented approximately as:

```text
["Why", " is", " the", " sky", " blue", "?"]
```

This is only an illustration. The actual split depends on the tokenizer used by the model.

Why use tokens instead of complete words?

There are far too many possible words, spellings, names, numbers, programming expressions, and combinations to treat every possible word as a separate fundamental unit. Tokenization gives the model a manageable vocabulary from which it can represent both familiar and unfamiliar text.

Each token is assigned a numerical identifier. Conceptually, the model receives something closer to this:

```text
[token_1, token_2, token_3, token_4, token_5, token_6]
```

rather than the written sentence we see.

## 3. Tokens become numerical representations

Token identifiers alone do not express useful relationships. The model therefore maps each token to a collection of numbers called a **vector**.

A vector might look like this:

```text
[0.12, -0.48, 0.73, ...]
```

Real model vectors contain many more values.

These starting vectors are learned during training. They give the model a numerical foundation for processing language. Information about the position of each token is also introduced, because word order matters:

> Dog bites man.

does not mean the same thing as:

> Man bites dog.

It is tempting to say that each token has a fixed vector containing its meaning. That is an incomplete picture. A token begins with a learned representation, but its representation is transformed as the model processes the surrounding context.

The word **blue**, for example, plays different roles in:

- blue sky;
- feeling blue;
- blue cheese;
- blue screen error;
- Monday blues.

The surrounding tokens help the model build a representation appropriate to the particular sentence.

Context matters in human communication too. If someone says, "A mother beat her daughter because she was drunk," and then asks, "Who was drunk?", you need surrounding context to answer confidently. Language models also rely on surrounding context, but they process it numerically rather than through human understanding.

## 4. The model processes the context

The token representations now pass through many layers of a neural network known as a **transformer**.

>Before we proceed further, let me put up straight that understanding how a model works is in itself a very beautiful and wide science. But, how they are developed and trained may not be required in answering what happens when we pronmpt chatGPT, so we will be leaving them out. But don't be mistaken, KAVRIQ is all about the martiage of AI and Maths, so this website will go in great depth for that aspect, but in different articles and posts.

One of the transformer's central mechanisms is **attention**. Attention allows the model to determine which earlier tokens are relevant while processing the sequence.

In our question:

> Why is the sky blue?

the representation of **blue** must be interpreted in relation to **sky**, while **why** signals that the expected response should contain an explanation.

This does not happen through a manually written rule such as:

```text
IF sentence contains "sky blue"
THEN explain light scattering
```

During training, the model adjusted a very large collection of numerical parameters by learning patterns from enormous amounts of text and other training data. In a limited sense, training teaches the model statistical patterns about language and the world as represented in that data.

Those learned parameters are now used to transform the numerical input representations layer by layer. By the end of this processing, the model has built a context-sensitive representation of the sequence. It then uses the representation at the current end of the sequence to estimate which token is most likely to come next.

## 5. The model calculates probabilities for the next token

ChatGPT does not normally produce the entire response in one step. It generates the answer incrementally.

Given the available sequence, the model calculates a score for every token in its vocabulary. Those scores are converted into a probability distribution.

For illustration, the first token of the response might have probabilities resembling:

```text
"The"        0.31
"Because"    0.24
"Sunlight"   0.18
"Blue"       0.06
other tokens 0.21
```

These numbers are invented for illustration, but the principle is real: the model assigns different probabilities to possible next tokens.

The model is therefore solving a problem of the form:

> Given everything available so far, which token should come next?

The important phrase is **so far**. The prediction depends on your prompt, the available conversation, any other supplied context, and every token already generated in the answer.

## 6. One token is selected

Once the probability distribution has been calculated, the system must select a token.

One possible strategy would always choose the token with the highest probability. That can make generation more predictable, but it is not the only possible strategy. A system can instead sample from the distribution, allowing a lower-probability token to be selected occasionally.

Settings such as **temperature** influence the shape of this distribution and therefore the variability of generation. Lower temperature generally concentrates probability on the stronger candidates. Higher temperature generally allows more variation.

This helps explain why the same question can sometimes receive differently worded answers. The model is not retrieving one permanently stored response. It is generating a new sequence under the current context and decoding settings.

The exact generation process can vary between models and products, but the essential idea remains: the model scores possible continuations and a decoding procedure selects the next token.

## 7. The process repeats

Suppose the selected first token is:

```text
"The"
```

That token is appended to the sequence. The model now predicts again:

```text
The → "sky"
```

Then again:

```text
The sky → "appears"
```

And again:

```text
The sky appears → "blue"
```

The loop continues:

```text
Read the sequence so far
→ Calculate next-token probabilities
→ Select a token
→ Append it
→ Repeat
```

This is called **autoregressive generation**: each newly generated token becomes part of the input used to generate the following token.

The response ends when the model produces an appropriate stopping signal or when another configured limit is reached.

## 8. Tokens become readable text

The generated result still consists of token identifiers. The tokenizer converts those identifiers back into pieces of text and combines them into a readable response.

ChatGPT can display the answer as it is being generated, which is why you often see words appearing progressively instead of waiting for the entire answer to arrive.

The visible response might begin:

> The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more strongly than longer wavelengths...

What looks like a continuously written paragraph was produced through a repeated cycle of token prediction and selection.

## The complete journey

We can now expand the original pipeline:

```text
1. You submit a prompt.
2. The system assembles the relevant input context.
3. The text is divided into tokens.
4. Tokens are mapped to numerical representations.
5. Transformer layers process those representations in context.
6. The model calculates probabilities for the next token.
7. A decoding procedure selects one token.
8. The selected token is appended to the sequence.
9. Steps 5–8 repeat until the response ends.
10. The generated tokens are converted into readable text.
```

## Does this mean ChatGPT is only guessing?

People sometimes hear “next-token prediction” and conclude that ChatGPT is making a random guess after every word.

That description is misleading.

The prediction is based on representations constructed by a large neural network from the entire available context. Producing a useful continuation may require the model to capture relationships involving grammar, facts, style, code, mathematical structure, and the apparent intention behind the prompt.

However, the generation objective does create an important limitation: producing a probable continuation is not the same as verifying that a statement is true.

A sentence can be:

- fluent;
- relevant;
- persuasive;
- and still factually incorrect.

This is one reason language models can produce hallucinations. Tools, retrieval, calculations, citations, verification steps, and human review can improve reliability, but the underlying language-generation process does not automatically guarantee truth.

## Does ChatGPT use the internet for every response?

No. The core model can generate answers using patterns represented in its learned parameters and the context supplied with the request.

For some questions, ChatGPT may use tools such as web search, data analysis, file reading, or connected sources. When that happens, the tool results become additional information that the model can use while generating the response.

Tool use extends the basic pipeline; it does not replace it:

```text
Prompt
→ Model decides that external information is needed
→ Tool retrieves or calculates information
→ Tool result is added to the context
→ Model generates a response from the expanded context
```

Whether a tool is available or used depends on the product, model, configuration, and request.

## Does ChatGPT remember everything you have said?

Not simply by keeping every past conversation permanently inside the model's immediate input.

Within a conversation, relevant earlier messages may be supplied as part of the current context. Product-level memory features can also provide selected information separately. These are different mechanisms from the model's learned parameters and from the temporary context used for one response.

That distinction matters because "memory" can refer to several different mechanisms: the current context, selected product-level memory, retrieved information, or patterns learned during training.

## A useful mental model

ChatGPT is not a database that searches for a complete answer and returns it unchanged. It is also not a person writing from a human train of thought.

A more useful starting model is:

> ChatGPT repeatedly predicts how a response should continue, using numerical representations built from the available context and patterns learned during training.

This mental model explains several behaviors:

- why wording and context affect the answer;
- why the same prompt can produce different responses;
- why context-window limits matter;
- why answers can sound confident while being wrong;
- why external tools and verification can improve reliability;
- and why response generation takes place token by token.

It is still a simplified picture. Modern systems may perform additional reasoning, use tools, retrieve information, apply safety checks, or route requests through different components. But tokens, contextual processing, next-token probabilities, and repeated generation remain central to understanding how a language model produces text.

PLANNED MURALI VIDEO

The primary animation should follow one prompt through the entire pipeline without getting too deep into any single stage. The goal is to make the invisible process feel visible: text becomes tokens, tokens become numbers, the model scores possible next tokens, and the response grows one token at a time.

### Suggested sequence

1. Show a user typing: **Why is the sky blue?**
2. Move the prompt into a processing area.
3. Add a small "context package" layer around it: instructions, relevant conversation, prompt, and optional tool results.
4. Divide the prompt into visible token blocks.
5. Replace each token with a compact column or row of numbers to represent vectors.
6. Show the vectors moving through several transformer layers.
7. Display a probability chart for possible first tokens.
8. Select one token and append it to the output line.
9. Repeat the probability-and-selection cycle at increasing speed.
10. Merge the generated token blocks into a readable response.
11. Zoom out to display the complete pipeline.

### Visual constraint

Keep the transformer stage conceptual. Do not imply that tokens merely pass through a single attention operation or that each starting vector permanently contains a word's complete meaning. The visual should suggest context-sensitive transformation, not fixed dictionary lookup.

### Reuse

The animation can become:

- the primary visual in this Explainer;
- a 45–60 second vertical video;
- the opening animation for the complete Explainers series;
- a reusable overview inside later articles about tokens, embeddings, sampling, context windows, and tool use.
