# Agentic AI Foundations

Agentic AI Foundations is Kavriq's 12-part core curriculum for learning the building blocks of modern agent systems.

This series starts from first principles and moves toward advanced concepts: agent loops, cognitive architecture, planning, tools, memory, multi-agent systems, guardrails, evaluation, runtime internals, and capstone projects.

If you want the systems-first production perspective after learning the components, continue into [Engineering Agent Systems](/learning/agentic-ai/v1/engineering-agent-systems).

> **This is a living roadmap.** Articles are written and published one by one. Items listed without a link are planned and coming. Linked items are published and ready to read.
