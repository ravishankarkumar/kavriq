title: AI & ML Engineer Interview Prep
layout: ../../layouts/TutorialPage.astro
---

A complete interview preparation guide for AI Engineer and ML Engineer roles. Covers everything from ML fundamentals to system design to behavioral questions, with code samples defaulting to Python.

The guide is structured around how interviews actually work at top AI companies. Q&A sections are concise by design — they tell you what to say in 2–3 minutes, with links to the deep-dive articles in ml-essentials and ai-engineering for the full derivations.

System design articles are full walkthroughs — because those questions are 45 minutes and require a complete thought process, not just a checklist.

> **This is a living roadmap.** Articles and Q&A pages are written and published one by one. Items listed without a link are planned and coming. Linked items are published and ready to read.

## How to Use This Guide

If you have **2 weeks**: Work through Sections 1–3 (Q&A), then focus on the 2–3 system design topics most relevant to the role. Do the coding patterns for the algorithms you're weakest on.

If you have **1 week**: Section 3 (LLMs and Agents) + 2 system design articles + the coding patterns for attention and sampling. These cover 80% of what AI engineer interviews actually test.

If you have **2 days**: The agent Q&A in Section 3, one system design article, and the behavioral section. Know your own work cold.

The deep technical content lives in [ml-essentials](/ml-essentials) and [ai-engineering](/ai-engineering). This guide tells you what to say — those guides tell you why it's true.
